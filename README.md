Groovy Coral 

A drawing program that changes size and color based on location on canvas. The circle x position can be controlled via mouse, but the y-position has a continuous movement from bottom to top, appearing to "bounce". The color value changes based on position, with slight randomization of the blue value. Mouse press will turn the circle dark gray. Any key press will clear the drawing.

Grace Boyle is an artist with degrees in chemistry and robotics. Her firm, The Feelies, explores storytelling through multi-sensory immersive VR medium. The talk explores the connection between mind, body, and the environment in ways that are much more complex than the Western understanding limited to five senses, when in reality, there are more than 30. Through working with Shinto practitioners in Japan and communities in the Brazilian Brazilian Amazon, The Feelies worked to capture elements of the natural world and represent them through a marriage of the digital and physical realms.

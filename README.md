Groovy Coral 

A drawing program that changes size and color based on location on canvas. The circle x position can be controlled via mouse, but the y-position has a continuous movement from bottom to top, appearing to "bounce". The color value changes based on position, with slight randomization of the blue value. Mouse press will turn the circle dark gray. Any key press will clear the drawing.
